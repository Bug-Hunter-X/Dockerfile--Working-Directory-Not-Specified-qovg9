This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to set a working directory. The bug is in DockerfileBug.dockerfile and the solution is in DockerfileSolution.dockerfile.  The bug causes the application to fail to run because the interpreter cannot find the script. The solution demonstrates how to correctly specify a working directory using the WORKDIR instruction.
